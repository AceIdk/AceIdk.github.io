** The World Over Heaven is the Stand of Heaven-Attained DIO featured in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven. It is an evolved variation of The World and considered by DIO to be the "Ultimate Stand". The World's original ability, which allows DIO to stop the flow of time. In stopped time, DIO can move his own body freely along with any object he touches that he wishes to move, allowing him to strike his defenseless enemies, move to a superior position, and toy with his victims. All force applied by DIO during the time stop continues to exist after the time stop. This is seen when objects that DIO throws can momentarily move during the time stopped time before grinding to a halt. A flurry of knives could fly for several meters before stopping.

Another unique feature of the time stop is how DIO can seemingly float in stopped time. Since no forces exist other than the time stopper's existence during a time stop, there is no force of gravity, allowing DIO to move freely in space as he wishes with the help of his stand.

Like previously, this allows DIO to move when no one else can, and attack his opponents when they are completely defenseless. While there is a possibility for the duration of The World Over Heaven's time stop to have increased from 9 seconds to an indefinite amount of time, it has never been stated. There are some implications, but nothing is concrete. **
